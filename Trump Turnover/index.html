    <p class="description">In the beginning of every presidency, the staff adjusts and changes as the President settles into the new role. Letting people go is not unordinary. However, the rate at which people left the Trump White House was higher than any other president in the last 37 years. In 2017, 23 of the top 65 White House and Cabinet positions experienced turnover. The last President to experience a significant amount of staff changes was President Ronald Reagan with 17% turnover in his first year.</p>
    <h2>Position changes in the first year</h2>

    <p>Around 4,000 people work for the Executive office of the President. The Brookings Institute identifies 65 of these people as the president’s most influencial staff members.</p>

    <h2>Turnover continues in 2018</h2>
    <p>In 2018, influential White House staffers have continued to move around and leave. Since Trump took office, <b>49% of his top influencers have left or changed positions</b> as of April 16, 2018.</p>

    <p>This amount of change matters. Each time a new person comes into a position, they have to be trained which costs time and money. Additionally, the longer a person holds a position and understands their role, the more valuable they become to the administration. </p>

    <p>Several Cabinet positions, staff appointed by the President and approved by the Senate, have also experienced significant turnover.</p>

    <p>There is a lot of speculation over the cause of the upheaval. In his campaign, Trump promised to ‘drain the swamp’ thereby appointing people who lacked government experience.</p>
    <p>Others point out that Trump seems to value loyalty over qualifications. Another cause could be the number of high-profile issues Trump experienced in his first year including the Russia investigation and nuclear threats from North Korea. Regardless of the particular reason, this level of turnover has stirred endless chaos in the West Wing, affecting U.S. legislation and government of its people.</p>
